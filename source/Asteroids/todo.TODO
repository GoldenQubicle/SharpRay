    3 damage stages x 3 lifes..? 
    each damage stage is N health
    each asteroid hit is -N health based on size
    asteroids destroyed ++points based on size
    points unlock powerups

    large => 7 mediums
    medium => 5 small

    small does 1 damage, medium does 5 damage? large does 35 damage..?
    also same point count..? 1 for small, 5 for mediu, 35 for large..?
    how many hits does it take for a asteroid to be destroyed?!
    have a health bar going from 0 - 100

    come in waves ..?
    spawn first big asteroid towards player position, in fact what about always spawning towards the current player position
    so to discourage camping in the corner or something
    can also consider breaking into more and more pieces as waves increase. atm it's hardcoded like 7 - 5 - 3
    also, atm drawing all asteroid at scale 1, can play with that to have more variety size wise 
    and in addition the 'reflection' speed bump is now 1.5, could also vary with size?!
☐ MVP Game Design, going w different levels.  @created(28-05-2022 20:20)
    asteroids have fixed number of hitpoints & scatter ratio
    difficulty progression comes from increasing bounciness, meteor spawn rate & size
    ship damage is sum of meteor hitpoint, e.g. meteor medium 3 hp, spawms 2 small 1 hp = 1 * 3 + 2 * 1 = 5 damage to ship

    Could fix this by first calculating the next position (pos + heading), then keep reflecting untill the next position returns the 
    meteor into screen bounds

✘ refactor asset loading @created(07-05-2022 16:49) @cancelled(02-06-2022 21:51)
    cancelled because will have to sort assets anyway when making a build, 
    so will change it around anyway
    make a proper asset record to hold the dicitonaries
    single function to pass regex & mapping functions
