First MileStone:
  ✔ be able to draw a rectangles, and undo/redo @created(06-06-2021 13:13) @done(06-06-2021 13:14)
    reason: handle ui stuff in somewhat sensible manner and proper undo / redo is very helpfull down the line
  ✔ be able to start and pause a timer @created(06-06-2021 13:13) @done(06-06-2021 14:04)
      reason: more ui interaction
  ✔ be able to control a rectange as 'player' character @created(07-06-2021 19:35) @done(07-06-2021 23:24)
    reason: flesh out ui event system and difference between ui components and game entities
  ✔ play a sound on button click @created(08-06-2021 18:17) @done(08-06-2021 18:17)
    reason: sound is part of a game after all
  ✘ be able to save rectangle and time elapsed to disk @created(06-06-2021 13:13) @cancelled(08-06-2021 19:00)
      reason: handle 'game' state in a smart way, i.e. do NOT save the ui components directly obviously
  ✘ be able to load from disk rectangle and time elapsed @created(06-06-2021 13:13) @cancelled(08-06-2021 19:00)
      reason: what's the point of saving it one can't load
  ✘ be able to continue timer once loaded @created(06-06-2021 13:13) @cancelled(08-06-2021 19:00)
      reason: proof of concept complete

  ✔ closing notes @created(08-06-2021 19:01) @done(08-06-2021 19:04)
      last 3 items are cancelled because current architecture is not fleshed out yet. 
      So in other words doing this prematurely would most likely hamper things down the road. 
      quick retrospective
      keep doing: small incremental changes
      stop doing: trying to fit everything into a single, unified api for no reason other than fabled 'consistency'
      what went well: event system is pretty nice so far and I look forward to using it
      what went less well: need to keep an eye on my own health and learn to enjoy the process

Second MileStone (ideas):
  ☐ snake game @created(07-06-2021 19:41)
    reason: simple yet effective proving grounds of capbilities. Would probably want to include 
    sound since that's important and I've got no experience with it so far. Could also opt to use 
    external assets for visuals as well. 
    So instead of going the usual route of fleshing out gameplay first lets first focus on loading 
    assets and the like and get something more decent than polygons going on screen. Could even opt to first build 
    the ui. 
    
TODO: 
  ☐ implement containsPoint polygon @created(06-06-2021 18:09)
  ☐ implement scale polygon @created(06-06-2021 18:09)
  ☐ proper click & double click mouse events @created(06-06-2021 14:21)
  ☐ investigate DI and project organisation @created(06-06-2021 13:17)

Ideas:
  ☐ manipulate a custom shader in realtime with ui controls @created(07-06-2021 19:41)
    reason: shaders are the bread and butter of a proper runnning game, technical challenging
    This idea came about while thinking about how to create a brush zoning tool so that could be a good
    first start. Like, scrollwheel changes size, on left click puts the brush down, etc. And this would also
    need to support undo / redo
