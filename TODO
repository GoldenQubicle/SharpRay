First MileStone:
  ✔ be able to draw a rectangles, and undo/redo @created(06-06-2021 13:13) @done(06-06-2021 13:14)
    reason: handle ui stuff in somewhat sensible manner and proper undo / redo is very helpfull down the line
  ✔ be able to start and pause a timer @created(06-06-2021 13:13) @done(06-06-2021 14:04)
      reason: more ui interaction
  ☐ be able to save rectangle and time elapsed to disk @created(06-06-2021 13:13)
      reason: handle 'game' state in a smart way, i.e. do NOT save the ui components directly obviously!
  ☐ be able to load from disk rectangle and time elapsed @created(06-06-2021 13:13)
      reason: what's the point of saving it one can't load
  ☐ be able to continue timer once loaded @created(06-06-2021 13:13)
      reason: proof of concept complete
